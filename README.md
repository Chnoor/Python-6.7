# Python-6.7: Gender-Based Violence on Women in Europe: Introduction:
Policy makers in Europe are confronted daily with the question of how to prioritize their budget and where and on what issues they should invest the social budget on in Europe. Gender equality affects the society as a whole and can reliably indicate how equal and democratic a society is towards all groups. Its absence on the other hand is a significant indicator of lack of tolerance and understanding in that society. A study of the predominance of gender-based violence in a society can tell us a lot about the situation of marginalized gender groups and whether they are violently discriminated against.
This study consists of the first step of analyzing gender equality in Europe by investigating fatal violence against women also known as femicide (killing of women because of their gender) and focuses mostly on the historical and statistical analysis of the homicide trend in Europe and its regions since 2000. 
# Objective:
Where in Europe is safer for women in terms of homicide probability and how the homicide rate has changed since 2000. In other words, are we witnessing a positive transition towards gender equality and gender security in Europe since 2000? 
# Hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: If a woman lives in a certain part of Europe, then it is more likely that that person will experience gender-based violence compared to a woman living in other subregions of Europe. 
Hypothesis 2: Homicide rate in Europe has decreased in the last decade. 
# Data set:
The dataset is an open and external data and is published by Gender Statistics of The World Bank and is collected annually and can be accessed [**here**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037654/Gender-Statistics)
